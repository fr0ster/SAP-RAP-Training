### üí™ What is an Action in SAP RAP
An **Action** is an explicit business operation that changes the state or structure of a Business Object, which cannot be realized through standard Create, Read, Update, Delete, or Lock operations.

Actions are used for:
- changing the status of an object (e.g., set an order "On Hold"),
- executing specific business logic or complex processing procedures (e.g., price recalculation, approval workflows),
- initiating mass or conditional changes that go beyond simple record creation or modification.

> üì¢ Standard CRUD operations: Read, Create, Update, Delete, Lock ‚Äî handle basic record management.
> Actions extend object capabilities to support specific business scenarios.

> üîç Example Actions:
> - Set On Hold (set order to waiting mode)
> - Release From Hold (remove order from hold)
> - Approve (approve an object)
> - Recalculate Pricing (recalculate prices based on new conditions)

### üî¢ Action Types
| Type | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| **Internal Action** | Triggered only within the Business Object logic, not available for external calls. |
| **Static Action** | Executed without reference to a specific instance, uses `%cid` for call identification. |
| **Repeatable Action** | Allows multiple executions on the same instance during a transaction using `%cid`. |
| **Factory Action** | Creates new instances in memory with temporary `%cid` identifiers, without immediate database persistence. |
| **Save Action** | Automatically triggered during the save phase to finalize changes before commit. |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è `%cid` ‚Äî Temporary identifier for objects created or modified during a transaction before database persistence. [More Details](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-rap/actions#define-actions)

### üë©‚Äçüíª Action Implementation Types
| Implementation Type | Description |
|:---------------------|:------------|
| **Instance Action** | Works with a specific instance via `%key`, must be tied to an existing record. |
| **Static Action** | Triggered without reference to a specific instance; `%cid` identifies the operation within the session. |
| **Action with Parameters** | Accepts a `%param` structure containing input data for processing. |
| **Action with Result Type Entity** | Creates new objects in memory with `%cid`, which will be persisted after Save. |
| **Factory Action** | Mass-creates new objects, allowing relation setup through `%cid_ref`. |

### üìö Special Parameters in SAP RAP Actions
| Symbol | Description | Link |
|:-------|:------------|:-----|
| **%cid** | Temporary local ID of an object created or modified during a transaction, used for linking instances in memory. | [SAP Help: Working with %cid](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-rap/actions#define-actions) |
| **%key** | Identifier of an existing Business Object instance, used to access or modify database records. | [SAP Help: Instance Actions and %key](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-rap/actions#instance-and-static-actions) |
| **%param** | Structure of parameters passed into the Action for additional input data. | [SAP Help: Actions with Parameters](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-rap/actions#actions-with-parameters) |

### ‚úèÔ∏è Defining Actions in Behavior Definition
```abap
define behavior for ZI_SalesOrder
persistent table ZSalesOrder
lock master
{
  action set_on_hold result [1] $self;
  action release_from_hold result [1] $self;
  static action refresh_all;
}
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementing Actions in Behavior Implementation
```abap
METHOD set_on_hold.
  LOOP AT keys INTO DATA(ls_key).
    UPDATE zsalesorder
      SET status = 'ON_HOLD'
      WHERE salesorder_id = @ls_key-salesorder_id.
  ENDLOOP.
ENDMETHOD.

METHOD release_from_hold.
  LOOP AT keys INTO DATA(ls_key).
    UPDATE zsalesorder
      SET status = 'RELEASED'
      WHERE salesorder_id = @ls_key-salesorder_id.
  ENDLOOP.
ENDMETHOD.

METHOD refresh_all.
  UPDATE zsalesorder
    SET last_refresh = sy-datum.
ENDMETHOD.
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Transactional Behavior of Actions
- Actions are executed within Save transactions.
- If an Action changes data, it must return `result`.
- Save Actions are only triggered during the Save Sequence.

### üìù Draft-enabled Actions
```abap
draft action submit result [1] $self;
draft action discard result [1] $self;
```

### üìã Action Validations
```abap
define behavior for ZI_SalesOrder
persistent table ZSalesOrder
lock master
{
  action set_on_hold result [1] $self;
  validate action set_on_hold on save { my_validation; }

  action release_from_hold result [1] $self;
  validate action release_from_hold on save { my_validation; }
}
```
