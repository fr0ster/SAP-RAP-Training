## üîç What is Feature Control?

Feature Control in SAP ABAP RAP (Restful ABAP Programming Model) enables the dynamic enabling or disabling of certain features or actions of business object instances based on specific conditions.

It allows fine-grained control over instance behavior at runtime without modifying the underlying data.

> **Example:** Enabling "Cancel Order" only when the order status is 'Submitted' and not 'Completed'.

## üéâ Why Use Feature Control?

- **Dynamic Behavior**: Adjust available user actions based on real-time business conditions.
- **User Guidance**: Prevent invalid actions and guide users through correct processes.
- **Security and Compliance**: Restrict access to sensitive operations under certain conditions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize unnecessary backend validations and checks.

## üåê Feature Control at Design-Time vs Runtime

| Aspect         | Design-Time                                   | Runtime                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition** | Declaring capabilities in Behavior Definition | Dynamically controlling features per instance    |
| **Focus**      | Structural possibilities                      | Conditional availability                         |
| **Example**    | Defining an Action "Cancel"                   | Disabling "Cancel" if Order is already Completed |

> Design-time: "Can this feature ever exist?"\
> Runtime: "Is this feature currently available?"

## üîß Defining Feature Control in Behavior Definition

You declare feature controls in the **behavior definition** (`.behavior` files).

```abap
define behavior for /DMO/R_Travel_D alias Travel
{
  association _Booking { create ( features : instance ); }

  field ( numbering : managed, readonly ) TravelUUID;
  field ( readonly ) TravelID, OverallStatus, TotalPrice, LocalCreatedAt, LocalCreatedBy, LocalLastChangedAt, LocalLastChangedBy, LastChangedAt;
  field ( mandatory ) CustomerID, AgencyID, BeginDate, EndDate, CurrencyCode;
  field ( features : instance ) BookingFee;

  action ( features : instance ) acceptTravel result [1] $self;
  action ( features : instance ) rejectTravel result [1] $self;
  action ( features : instance ) deductDiscount parameter /DMO/A_TRAVEL_DISCOUNT result [1] $self;
}
```

**Notes:**

- The `feature-control` keyword links a feature (like an action) to runtime control logic.
- You can define feature control for actions, fields, and other operations.

## üë©‚Äçüíº Implementing Feature Control in Behavior Implementation

You implement feature control logic inside the **behavior implementation class**.

### Example Implementation

```abap
METHOD get_instance_features.

  READ ENTITIES OF /DMO/R_Travel_D IN LOCAL MODE
    ENTITY Travel
      FIELDS ( OverallStatus )
      WITH CORRESPONDING #( keys )
    RESULT DATA(travels)
    FAILED failed.

  result = VALUE #( FOR ls_travel IN travels
                      ( %tky                   = ls_travel-%tky

                        %field-BookingFee      = COND #( WHEN ls_travel-OverallStatus = travel_status-accepted
                                                         THEN if_abap_behv=>fc-f-read_only
                                                         ELSE if_abap_behv=>fc-f-unrestricted )
                        %action-acceptTravel   = COND #( WHEN ls_travel-OverallStatus = travel_status-accepted
                                                         THEN if_abap_behv=>fc-o-disabled
                                                         ELSE if_abap_behv=>fc-o-enabled )
                        %action-rejectTravel   = COND #( WHEN ls_travel-OverallStatus = travel_status-rejected
                                                         THEN if_abap_behv=>fc-o-disabled
                                                         ELSE if_abap_behv=>fc-o-enabled )
                        %action-deductDiscount = COND #( WHEN ls_travel-OverallStatus = travel_status-accepted
                                                         THEN if_abap_behv=>fc-o-disabled
                                                         ELSE if_abap_behv=>fc-o-enabled )
                        %assoc-_Booking        = COND #( WHEN ls_travel-OverallStatus = travel_status-rejected
                                                        THEN if_abap_behv=>fc-o-disabled
                                                        ELSE if_abap_behv=>fc-o-enabled )
                      ) ).

ENDMETHOD.

```

**Key Points:**

- **requested_features** tells which features to check.
- **result_features** indicates which features are enabled or disabled.
- Constants like `IF_ABAP_BEHV=>FC_ENABLED` and `IF_ABAP_BEHV=>FC_DISABLED` are used.

## üîÑ Best Practices for Feature Control

| Practice                                 | Reason                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Keep logic simple                        | Avoid complex dependencies that are hard to debug |
| Minimize DB access                       | Preload necessary fields if possible              |
| Clearly document controlled features     | Easy maintenance and debugging                    |
| Separate feature checks from validations | Avoid confusion of purposes                       |
| Always return consistent results         | Unclear states can cause frontend errors          |

## üí° Common Scenarios

- **Actions**: Allow "Cancel" or "Approve" actions based on status.
- **Field Editability**: Make fields editable/read-only dynamically.
- **Instance Lifecycle Control**: Enable deletion only under specific circumstances.
- **Multi-Step Processes**: Progressively unlock features step-by-step.

[üìã Examples: Developing Feature Control | SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-rap/developing-feature-control)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Mistakes to Avoid

- **Hardcoding feature availability** instead of checking business data.
- **Ignoring performance** by querying the database for every instance.
- **Not aligning design-time and runtime** definitions.
- **Mixing validation and feature control responsibilities**.
- **Failing to cover edge cases**, e.g., status transitions.
